  </div>
  <div class="column right">
  <p>Passionate about <font color="lightpink">conservation planning</font> and <font color="skyblue">environmental management</font>, Shuhan is currently studying **Environmental Science and Management** at Bren School at UCSB in the completion of her master's degree. She is seeking a career that will create and protect a more <i><font color="forestgreen">sustainable</font>, <font color="lightseagreen">diverse</font>, and <font color="indianred">productive</font> <strong>ecosystem</strong></i>. She loves being in the <font color="seagreen">field</font> to observe and learn no less than sitting in front of a <font color="darksalmon">computer</font> to code and map. Born in Beijing, China, Shuhan speaks both <font color="steelblue">English and Mandarin</font>. In her free time, she enjoys <font color="palevioletred">drawing</font>, <font color="olivedrab">hiking</font>, <font color="mediumorchid">visiting museums</font>, and <font color="plum">listening to jazz and violin solo</font> (link to [Violin Concerto No1. in D major by Mengla Huang and the string quintet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNM1CkCfjsk)). Fun fact: She has been a big fan of [Pablo Ruiz Picasso](about_me/picasso.JPG) since the age of five.

  </small>
  </h4> 
  <h5>Qianyanzhou Ecological Research Station, Chinese Academy of Science</h5>
  <ul>
  <li>Resurveyed 4000+ pioneer pines (Masson’s Pine and Slash Pine) in 36 forest plantation plots for a landscape restoration program to evaluate tree growth and canopy change by measuring breast height diameter, crown width, and crown closure in collaboration with a 12-member research team.</li>
  <li>Assembled species diversity data and total coverage data of herbaceous plants and young woody plants to examine the underfloor development in each plot in comparison with last year’s data. </li>
  <li>Sampled and measured the fresh/dry weight of fallen leaves, branches, fruits and seeds on forest floor in each plot to analyze the organic input of soil and nutrient recycling process.</li>
  </ul>

<br>

  <h4>**Herpetology Curatorial Assistant**
  <small class="text-muted"> Berkeley, CA (9/18-5/19) 
  </small>
